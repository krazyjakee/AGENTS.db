## Agent-Specific Notes

This repository includes a compiled documentation database/knowledgebase at `AGENTS.db`.
For context for any task, you MUST use MCP `agents_search` to look up context including architectural, API, and historical changes.
Treat `AGENTS.db` layers as immutable; avoid in-place mutation utilities unless required by the design.
